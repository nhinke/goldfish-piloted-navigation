## Goldfish-Piloted Navigation (GPN)
  
The purpose of this repo is to develop a system that allows a goldfish to pilot an [iRobot Create 3](https://edu.irobot.com/what-we-offer/create3) using the exposed ROS 2 Galactic [interface](https://iroboteducation.github.io/create3_docs/api/ros2/). At a high level, this system works by using computer vision/image processing techniques to monitor and estimate the position of a goldfish within a fish bowl mounted to the [Create 3](https://edu.irobot.com/what-we-offer/create3) via a camera positioned directly above it. The continuously updating position estimates are then used to determine both the speed and heading of the [Create 3](https://edu.irobot.com/what-we-offer/create3), with the exception of when obstacles or hazards are detected.
  
This project was inspired by [this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166432821005994?dgcid=author#fig0005) similar "Fish Operated Vehicle" built for a research project at Ben-Gurion University.
